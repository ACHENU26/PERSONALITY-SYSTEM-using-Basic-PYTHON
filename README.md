# PERSONALITY SYSTEM using Basic PYTHON
## Machine Learning Project
The objective is to create a simple machine learning project in which we built a personality system! 

We used an unsupervised learning algorithm, k-means, to divide people into 23 distinct personality types. 

## Background Information

From Wikipedia

The Big Five personality traits, also known as the five-factor model (FFM) and the OCEAN model, is a taxonomy, or grouping, for personality traits. 

When factor analysis (a statistical technique) is applied to personality survey data, some words used to describe aspects of personality are often applied to the same person. For example, someone described as conscientious is more likely to be described as "always prepared" rather than "messy". 

This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments. This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche.
